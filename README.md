## Backstory

#### The father's POV

It’s been a week. People have already stopped searching for him.. my son, my little boy. It’s only been a week and people have lost all hope for him. How could they? My dear boy, I told him about the dangers of the forest, yet his unimpeachable soul went ahead to explore and play. But who am I to blame him, being his father, his guardian, his biggest supporter, and protector, yet I was the one who let him go? I shouldn’t have let him go. 

Now there’s no going back, the only thing I can do is fight for him. I want my son back at all costs. I'm going to prepare myself. I’ll do anything for him because I have hope and faith. I know that he’s alive, he’s strong and I know he’s alive, I will find him. After all, a true father's intuition is always correct.
