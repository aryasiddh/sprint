## Backstory

#### The father's POV

It’s been a week. People have already stopped searching for her.. my daughter, my little girl. It’s only been a week and people have lost all hope for her. How could they? My dear girl, I told her about the dangers of the forest, yet her unimpeachable soul went ahead to explore and play. But who am I to blame her, being her father, her guardian, her biggest supporter, and protector, yet I was the one who let her go? I shouldn’t have let her go.

Now there’s no going back, the only thing I can do is fight for her. I want my daughter back at all costs. I'm going to prepare myself. I’ll do anything for her because I have hope and faith. I know that she’s alive, she’s strong and I know she’s alive, I will find her. After all, a true father's intuition is always correct.
